# Linux lab at the university

I decided to put the scripts, written during my UNIX/LINUX operating systems class, on github. 
The script lab6.sh creates a folder with the given name and permissions, and a file in that folder, with the given name and permissions. 
The lab7.sh script can be run with one parameter - the student's index (at my university the indexes are, for example, s123456), or without any parameters, 
in which case the index of the person running the script is chosen. Depending on the chosen functionality, you can display the total number of students 
(based on the home folders that contain the indexes in their names), the total time logged in since the beginning of the semester (for the set index), 
the home folder permissions of the currently logged in users, you can also specify the path to the file that contains the listed folder, 
and display information about that folder, obtained from that file. Finally, it is also possible to save the results to a file, at the user's location.
